**SDE885 - Assignment 0 - Version 1.04**

Assignment Objectives
===============================================================================
- Retrieve the starter code and set up your own Git repository  
- Set up your working environment and compile your code  
- Practice using programming libraries  

Retrieving the Starter Code
===============================================================================

## Installing Git

You must have Git installed on your computer and properly configured.

- Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win  
- Linux: https://git-scm.com/download/linux  
- macOS: https://git-scm.com/download/mac  

Git is a command-line program: open Git Bash to enter the following commands, or use a terminal if you are on GNU/Linux or macOS.

## GitHub Classroom

Assignments will be done through GitHub Classroom. To participate, you need to create a GitHub account.  

__The link to join the GitHub Classroom is available on Moodle. Be careful to use the correct link depending on whether you choose Rust or C++.__

!!! ERROR: Attention  
    You may experiment with both languages in Assignment 0. However, after Assignment 1, it will be very difficult to switch programming languages.

You can follow the official GitHub documentation for configuration: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git  

## Your Own Git Repository

After accepting the GitHub Classroom invitation, a new private Git repository will be created.  
To clone this repository, you must use the following command:
```bash
git clone --recursive <URL-du-depot>
```
If you did not use the `--recursive` option, you can run the following two commands to properly initialize the dependencies:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
!!! WARNING  
    This working directory will be used for all assignments (from the first to the last). Be careful not to commit binaries or large files.  

    Updates to this code will be provided either through a *pull request* or a patch.  

!!! ERROR: Attention  
    Your repository must contain *your own solution*. This directory must remain *private*. It is not allowed to make this repository public for any reason.  

Environment Setup
===============================================================================

Assignments in this course will be done in either C++ or Rust. The following programs must be installed on your personal machine:  
- Git: version control, used to retrieve and synchronize the starter code  
- CMake: enables cross-platform compilation  
- Recent C++ compiler: must support at least C++17  

This first assignment describes the setup steps for different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).  

For Rust, I will only describe its installation on Windows and Visual Studio Code.  

Visual Studio Code (all platforms / Rust)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Rust on your machine, use the following site: https://rustup.rs/. This site will ask you to run a command or launch a local installer. This will install the latest stable version of Rust.  

Next, install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/.  

Finally, launch Visual Studio Code with your project and install the following extension: `rust-analyzer`. Note that during installation or at restart, Visual Studio Code may ask you to install additional components for Rust (via Cargo). Accept them.

To compile Assignment 0, open a terminal and run the following command in the project folder:  
```
cargo run --release --example=devoir0 --
```
All dependencies as well as the starter code will compile automatically.  

Assignment
===============================================================================

In this assignment, we will get familiar with some concepts covered in class related to colors and linear algebra.  
Open the file corresponding to the assignment: `examples/devoir0.rs`.  
You will edit this file directly. Do not be intimidated by its size: it contains many comments. Read them carefully, as they provide instructions on how to complete the different tasks.  

You can use the following command to recompile and run the code:  
```
cargo run --release --example=devoir0 --
```
Note that the working directory is the folder where `cargo` is executed.  

## Task 1: Linear Algebra

Go to the function `task_1_maths()` and fix all the __TODO__ items as well as any errors displayed during execution.  

## Task 2: Colors and Images

Go to the function `task_2_images(...)` and fix all the __TODO__ items as well as any errors displayed during execution.  

The image corresponding to the bilinear interpolation you must obtain is the following:  

![This image is also available in `scenes/devoir0/ref-bilinear.png`](../scenes/devoir0/ref-bilinear.png)  

The image corresponding to the grayscale conversion of `../scenes/devoir0/island.jpg` is the following:  

![This image is also available in `scenes/devoir0/ref-luminance.png`](../scenes/devoir0/ref-luminance.png)  

If you have issues loading the `island.jpg` image, you can use the `-i` argument to specify another path.  

## Submitting Your Assignment
Submit on Moodle an archive containing:  
- `devoir_0.rs`  
- the execution log of the assignment `devoir_0_output.txt`. To generate this log:  
  `cargo run --release --example=devoir0 -- -l devoir_0_output.txt`
